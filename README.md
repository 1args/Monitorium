# WPF App

Used:
- MVVM Pattern
- Command operation via RelayCommand, ObservableObject via INotifyPropertyChanged
- DependencyInjection
- Own navigation service
- Splitting into separate styles
- .NET 9

The project contains an example of clean architecture through the use of modern, relevant solutions. MainWindow is used as the main window. Pages are represented by UserControl elements. The interface may not look great, because I'm not very creative.

Added nuget packages:
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- MahApps.Metro.IconPacks
- System.Management

Work on the project is extended. When the project is finished, you will be able to watch the result in the form of a video.
